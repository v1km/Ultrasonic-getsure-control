Components:
2 * SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Arduino uno
Usb cable
Wires

Connections:
SENSOR 1------------Arduino 
VCC-----------------5v
GND-----------------gnd
TRIGGER-------------pin4
ECHO----------------pin3


SENSOR 2------------Arduino 
VCC-----------------5v
GND-----------------gnd
TRIGGER-------------pin6
ECHO----------------pin5

BOTH SENSORS ARE APPROXIMATELY BE PLACED AT 15cm APART OF EACH OTHER WITH STABLE HOLDING.
SENSOR1 IS PLACED ON LEFT SIDE.
IN THE CODE THE IF ELSE CONTAINS COMMENT SECTION MENTIONED:
// ACTION DESIRED
HERE YOU CAN PERFORM ANY ACTION WHICH IS DESIRED BY YOU LIKE GLOWING DIFFERENT COLORED LED FOR SEVERAL CASES MENTIONED:
CASE 1:
YOU HAVE SWEEPED YOUR HAND RIGHT SIDE.
CASE 2:
YOU HAVE SWEEPED YOUR HAND LEFT SIDE.
CASE 3:
YOUR HAND IS CONSTANTLY ON  BOTH SIDE.
CASE 4:
YOUR HAND IS CONSTANTLY ON LEFT SIDE.
CASE 5:
YOUR HAND IS CONSTANTLY ON RIGHT SIDE.
CASE 6:
YOUR HAND IS NONE OF THE SIDE.

USING THIS 6 CASES IN CODE YOU CAN PERFORM SIX DIFFERENT ACTIONS BY USING GESTURES WHICH CAN BE USEFUL FOR PHYSICALLY DISABLED.
YOU CAN ADD IR LIBRARY AND CHANGE THE CHANNELS & VOLUME & POWER BY IT OR JUST ADD DC MOTORS TO CONTROL THE CAR .

I HAVE UPLOADED A PROCESSING CODE WHICH CAN BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE SIX CASES BY DIFFERENT COLOR ON THE SCREEN.
